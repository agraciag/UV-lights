* UVA (315-400 nm)
* UVB (280-315 nm)
* UVC (100-280 nm).

[OMS UV Index](https://www.who.int/uv/intersunprogramme/activities/uv_index/en/)

> The UVI is a measure of the level of UV radiation.
The values of the index range from zero upward - the higher the UVI, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eye, and the less time it takes for harm to occur.
The UVI is an important vehicle to alert people about the need to use sun protection.
A marked increase in the incidence of skin cancer in fair-skinned populations worldwide is strongly associated with excessive UV radiation exposure from the sun and possibly artificial sources such as sunbeds. Current evidence indicates that personal habits in relation to sun exposure constitute the most important individual risk factor for UV radiation damage.

> What is unique about UV-C radiation is that it is especially effective at disinfection. In particular, the wavelength of 264 nm is incredibly impressive at killing germs, viruses and bacteria. Fortunately, UV-C radiation can pass through air without creating ozone, so UV-C lamps can be used in air to disinfect surfaces. Some people may be concerned that using a UV-C LED lamp will create ozone (a health and environmental hazard).   However, only the vacuum-LED wavelengths can create ozone (<200 nm). UV-A, UV-B and UV-C wavelengths do not transform oxygen (in air) into ozone.

[UV Light That Is Safe for Humans but Bad for Bacteria and Viruses](https://www.genengnews.com/topics/translational-medicine/uv-light-that-is-safe-for-humans-but-bad-for-bacteria-and-viruses/)

> Scientists have known for decades that broad-spectrum UVC light, which has a wavelength of between 200 to 400 nanometers (nm), is highly effective at killing bacteria and viruses by destroying the molecular bonds that hold their DNA together. This conventional UV light is routinely used to decontaminate surgical equipment.

> far-UVC could kill microbes without damaging healthy tissue. Moreover, the researchers demonstrated that far-UVC light was effective at killing MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria, a common cause of surgical wound infections, but without harming human or mouse skin.

> El esterilizador ultravioleta en el vehículo de Yanfeng utiliza tecnología violeta, que puede detectar con seguridad si hay personas en el automóvil y luego puede desinfectar la cabina, los asientos y el volante en 10 minutos. El módulo de esterilización se instala en la parte superior del automóvil para maximizar la cobertura del área de esterilización efectiva y puede lograr una tasa de esterilización del 99.9% de las bacterias y virus dañinos en el automóvil.

[REFERENCIA DE ENERGIA NECESARIA PARA DESACTIVAR BACTERIA Y VIRUS] (https://www.ledinside.com/news/2020/4/uvcled_microwave)
> Researchers built a microwave-like equipment which include two separate UVC LED modules with 10 UVC LEDs embedded respectively. Each UVC LED has a power of 100 mW, making the total UVC radiation 2W and achieving a **radiation dose of 800 J / m²** in just a few seconds. The amount of radiation dose can effectively inactivate bacteria and viruses.
